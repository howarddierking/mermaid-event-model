_Describe the high-level intent of this slice in prose. What user-visible capability does it represent? Why does it matter? When does it run, and what constraint or invariant does it preserve?_

			# read models that must be present.
		when
			# The command (or signal) under test. Omit `when`

			# models, signals to external systems.
